one problem i encountered is in trying to get the alternating background colors to stretch the entire width of the page,
while keeping the content itself centered along the horizontal axis and constrained to a maximum width. In other words, the
background wants to stick to the width of the content and not stretch the whole page, so setting a page container with a
maximum width only lets you set a background color for that width.
